        By default, you cannot create an appointment for a participant with a conflict during the
        time of the appointment. If desired, you can disable this check by setting the
        skip_constraints param to true.


        You are also able to call the create appointment API with a member token when you are
        building a member-facing experience. In that case, members are only able to book an
        appointment for themselves. Appointments created by members must follow the rules of the
        selected appointment type, and the constraint checks may not be bypassed.

                    By default, Source runs a number of checks to prevent you from creating
                    appointments that seem unsafe. For example, we prevent you from creating
                    appointments that take place in the past, from creating appointments outside of
                    the bookable window for an appointment type, from creating appointments that
                    require licensure with unlicensed participants, or from creating appointments
                    during which one of the participants has a conflict.


                    When calling the appointments endpoints with your API key, you can override this
                    behavior by setting the skip_constraints param to true, allowing you to create
                    your appointment. Note that some checks, such as ensuring the appointment end
                    time is after the start time, cannot be bypassed.

                        use the value `custom` to provide your own video call link.  When providing
                        `custom`, you must provide a join URL and can optionally include a token or

                        for 'custom' video calls - for 'source' video calls, we generate the join

                    Members may not override the video call settings of an appointment, but users
                    and API keys are able to set `provider: 'source'` to create a Source-managed
                    call, or provide the details of a third-party video call.


                    It is not possible to modify the video call provider of an appointment, once

        Parameters that are omitted from this endpoint will be left untouched. When changing the
        time of an appointment, you can provide an updated start_at and duration. If you omit one of
        these two, it will be inferred from the current state of the event.


        When adding participants to an existing appointment, Source will only perform conflict
        checks on the newly added participants, ignoring any potential conflicts for participants
        who are already on the appointment. You may bypass this check by setting the
        skip_constraintss param to true.

                    By default, Source runs a number of checks to prevent you from creating
                    appointments that seem unsafe. For example, we prevent you from creating
                    appointments that take place in the past, from creating appointments outside of
                    the bookable window for an appointment type, from creating appointments that
                    require licensure with unlicensed participants, or from creating appointments
                    during which one of the participants has a conflict.


                    When calling the appointments endpoints with your API key, you can override this
                    behavior by setting the skip_constraints param to true, allowing you to create
                    your appointment. Note that some checks, such as ensuring the appointment end
                    time is after the start time, cannot be bypassed.

                        `custom`, you must provide a join URL and can optionally include a token or

                    Members may not override the video call settings of an appointment, but users
                    and API keys are able to set `provider: 'source'` to create a Source-managed

                    Defines how an incoming slot availability query for the appointment type should
                    be routed to possible users. Because of the complexity in routing, it's best
                    explained by example. Assume you have created an appointment type that can be
                    fulfilled by users in the Physicians group. The behavior of each routing
                    strategy is as follows:


                    - care_team_required - Appointment slots will only be shown for Physicians who
                    are on the member's care team. If there are   no Physicians on the member's care
                    team, the request will fail.


                    - care_team_preferred - Appointment slots will be shown for any Physicians on
                    the member's care team.   If the Physicians on the care team aren't available,
                    slots will not be returned.   If there are no Physicians on the member's care
                    team, then slots will be returned for any available Physician.


                    - care_team_hybrid - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the
                    Physicians group. For any given appointment slot,   if a Physician of the
                    member's care team is available, they will be preferred. However, slots for
                    other Physicians will   still be shown.


                    - round_robin - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the Physicians
                    group, and no preference will be given to   users who are also on the member's
                    care team.


                    By default, Source uses the care_team_preferred strategy to provide continuity
                    of care and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not
                    always the right booking strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a single
                    practice, you may sometimes need to reach for another routing method.


                    If you have a need for a routing model that isn't covered above, please don't
                    hesitate to reach out to our team.

                    group is specified, you will not be able to use the appointment slot API to find
                    bookable slots. When using the appointment slot API, you can specify more
                    specific users and groups. For example, if your appointment type is linked to
                    the group "Physicians," and when calling the slot API you provide an include
                    parameter for the group "Nurses," you only receive available slots for users who
                    are in both the Physicians and Nurses group.

                    returned. When booking an appointment without the skip_constraints parameter,
                    any licensed user must have a matching license type, otherwise a warning will be
                    returned. If more than one license code is provided, a licensed user with any of
                    the license codes can participate in the appointment. Providing any value will
                    override the entire array. Providing null or an empty array will empty out the

        Appointments are linked to appointment types in Source, so changes made to an appointment
        type will be visible on past appointments as well. However, some fields, such as the
        duration and location of the appointment, are copied at the time the appointment is created.
        Changing the duration of an appointment type will not change the duration of past
        appointments.

                    Defines how an incoming slot availability query for the appointment type should
                    be routed to possible users. Because of the complexity in routing, it's best
                    explained by example. Assume you have created an appointment type that can be
                    fulfilled by users in the Physicians group. The behavior of each routing
                    strategy is as follows:


                    - care_team_required - Appointment slots will only be shown for Physicians who
                    are on the member's care team. If there are   no Physicians on the member's care
                    team, the request will fail.


                    - care_team_preferred - Appointment slots will be shown for any Physicians on
                    the member's care team.   If the Physicians on the care team aren't available,
                    slots will not be returned.   If there are no Physicians on the member's care
                    team, then slots will be returned for any available Physician.


                    - care_team_hybrid - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the
                    Physicians group. For any given appointment slot,   if a Physician of the
                    member's care team is available, they will be preferred. However, slots for
                    other Physicians will   still be shown.


                    - round_robin - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the Physicians
                    group, and no preference will be given to   users who are also on the member's
                    care team.


                    By default, Source uses the care_team_preferred strategy to provide continuity
                    of care and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not
                    always the right booking strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a single
                    practice, you may sometimes need to reach for another routing method.


                    If you have a need for a routing model that isn't covered above, please don't
                    hesitate to reach out to our team.

                    Select the groups that should be evaluated when booking an appointment. If no
                    group is specified, you will not be able to use the appointment slot API to find
                    bookable slots. When using the appointment slot API, you can specify more
                    specific users and groups. For example, if your appointment type is linked to
                    the group "Physicians," and when calling the slot API you provide an include
                    parameter for the group "Nurses," you only receive available slots for users who
                    are in both the Physicians and Nurses group.

                    returned. When booking an appointment without the skip_constraints parameter,
                    any licensed user must have a matching license type, otherwise a warning will be
                    returned. If more than one license code is provided, a licensed user with any of
                    the license codes can participate in the appointment. Providing any value will

                    Defines how a new task should be routed to the possible users defined in
                    `routing_targets`. Because of the complexity in routing, it's best explained by
                    example. Assume you have created a task that must be completed by a user in the
                    Physicians group, which you have specified in the queue's `routing_targets. The
                    behavior of each routing strategy is as follows:


                    * care_team_required - The task will be assigned only to a user who is in the
                    Physicians group and who is on the member's care team. If there are no
                    Physicians on the member's care team, the task will remain unassigned. If there
                    are multiple Physicians on the member's care team, the first physician on the
                    care team will be assigned the task.


                    * care_team_preferred - The task will be assigned to a user who is in the
                    Physicians group and is on the member's care team, if there are any. If there
                    are no Physicians on the member's care team, the task will be assigned to
                    another user in the Physicians group.


                    * round_robin - The task will be assigned to a user in the Physicians group, and
                    no preference will be given to users who are also on the member's care team.


                    If more than one group is listed in the queue's `routing_targets`, each group
                    will be evaluated in order until a user assignment is found. If no user is found
                    in any group, the task will remain unassigned. 


                    By default, Source uses the `care_team_required` strategy to provide continuity
                    of care and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not
                    always the right task assignment strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a
                    single practice, you may sometimes need to reach for another routing method.

      description: >-
        An appointment represents a scheduled block of time for one or more users, optionally with
        an associated member.


        Depending on your needs, you can create appointment resources in Source to reflect events
        that have been scheduled elsewhere, or use our availability APIs to power patient
        self-scheduling directly. Creating and representing your appointments in Source allows your
        team to have a single pane of glass for their work day.


        When creating and managing appointments via the API, members have a different level of
        access than users or API keys. Members are only able to book appointments during a time when
        users are available, and are required to follow the restrictions of the appointment type.
        Users and API keys can bypass these restrictions by setting skip_constraints to true.

          description: >-
            Defines how an incoming slot availability query for the appointment type should be
            routed to possible users. Because of the complexity in routing, it's best explained by
            example. Assume you have created an appointment type that can be fulfilled by users in
            the Physicians group. The behavior of each routing strategy is as follows:


            - care_team_required - Appointment slots will only be shown for Physicians who are on
            the member's care team. If there are   no Physicians on the member's care team, the
            request will fail.


            - care_team_preferred - Appointment slots will be shown for any Physicians on the
            member's care team.   If the Physicians on the care team aren't available, slots will
            not be returned.   If there are no Physicians on the member's care team, then slots will
            be returned for any available Physician.


            - care_team_hybrid - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the Physicians
            group. For any given appointment slot,   if a Physician of the member's care team is
            available, they will be preferred. However, slots for other Physicians will   still be
            shown.


            - round_robin - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the Physicians group,
            and no preference will be given to   users who are also on the member's care team.


            By default, Source uses the care_team_preferred strategy to provide continuity of care
            and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not always the right
            booking strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a single practice, you may
            sometimes need to reach for another routing method.


            If you have a need for a routing model that isn't covered above, please don't hesitate
            to reach out to our team.

            Select the groups that should be evaluated when booking an appointment. If no group is
            specified, you will not be able to use the appointment slot API to find bookable slots.
            When using the appointment slot API, you can specify more specific users and groups. For
            example, if your appointment type is linked to the group "Physicians," and when calling
            the slot API you provide an include parameter for the group "Nurses," you only receive
            available slots for users who are in both the Physicians and Nurses group.

      title: Appointment Type
      description: >-
        Appointment types describe the different types of appointments that members can book with
        you.


        Each appointment type has associated configuration that describes how events of that type
        should be booked, including when they're available to be booked, the standard duration and
        timing information, as well as with whom they can be booked. You can create and manage
        appointment types based on your specific booking needs.


        Note that appointment types include several fields which are copied to an appointment at the
        time of creation. These fields, such as the duration, pre buffer and post buffer, can be
        changed on the appointment type at any time, but will not be reflected on appointments of
        that type which have already been booked.

            considered to be in "local" time, so they are impossible to interpret without a time
            zone.


            Note that while availability schedules have a time zone field on them for reference, the
            time zone is replicated from the bookable resource to which the schedule is attached
            (currently only users). If you want to change the time zone for the schedule, you need
            to instead change the time zone on the user. Source will automatically detect the time
            zone change and update the schedule as well, triggering an `availability.updated` event
            with the new zone.

      description: >-
        Availability describes the schedule for a particular user and is used to power appointment
        booking.


        By default, users are created with a schedule that marks them unavailable at all times.
        While this is a safe default, it means that members can't book appointments until you set up
        proper schedules.


        Note that availability is unique to each environment, so a user has a different schedule in
        live mode and test mode. Additionally, availability does not have a standard list or
        retrieve endpoint like most other resources. Instead, availability is a child resource of
        the user to which it belongs. Availability reosurces do still trigger events when they are
        modified.

      description: >-
        Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account.


        When an interesting event occurs, we create a new Event object. For example, when a member
        is created, we create a `member.created` event; and when an measurement is received we
        create a 'measurement.created' event. The shape of the object in the `data` property of the
        event will be the object associated with the type of event. For example, a `member.created`
        event will have a data property containing the Member object.


        Note that some actions may cause multiple events to be created. For example, when a device
        order is fulfilled you will receive both an order.fulfilled event and a device.created event
        for each device sent in the order.


        You can view more information about receiving Source events via webhooks
        [here](https://docs.sourcehealth.com/docs/api/webhooks/).

            Defines how a new task should be routed to the possible users defined in
            `routing_targets`. Because of the complexity in routing, it's best explained by example.
            Assume you have created a task that must be completed by a user in the Physicians group,
            which you have specified in the queue's `routing_targets. The behavior of each routing
            strategy is as follows:


            * care_team_required - The task will be assigned only to a user who is in the Physicians
            group and who is on the member's care team. If there are no Physicians on the member's
            care team, the task will remain unassigned. If there are multiple Physicians on the
            member's care team, the first physician on the care team will be assigned the task.


            * care_team_preferred - The task will be assigned to a user who is in the Physicians
            group and is on the member's care team, if there are any. If there are no Physicians on
            the member's care team, the task will be assigned to another user in the Physicians
            group.


            * round_robin - The task will be assigned to a user in the Physicians group, and no
            preference will be given to users who are also on the member's care team.


            If more than one group is listed in the queue's `routing_targets`, each group will be
            evaluated in order until a user assignment is found. If no user is found in any group,
            the task will remain unassigned. 


            By default, Source uses the `care_team_required` strategy to provide continuity of care
            and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not always the right
            task assignment strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a single practice, you may
            sometimes need to reach for another routing method.

        Slots represent chunks of time where a user is available for an appointment with a member.


        Source's scheduling APIs can be used to power rich member self-booking workflows. Typically,
        these experiences start by presenting a list of available appointment types (by querying the
        appointment types resource), and then present a list of slots by querying the slot
        availability APIs documented here.


        Unlike most other resources in the Source API, slots are not stored. As a result, they do
        not have an identifier, nor do they trigger any kind of events. Instead, slots are
        dynamically calculated as needed based on the availability of people in your team.

      title: Task
      description: >-
        A Task represents a request for the care team to perform an action on behalf of a member.
        Tasks are the fundamental backbone of workflow in Source. Any time you need to surface
        information to a member of the care team, tasks should probably be your default choice.


        Each task is backed by a task definition which gives information about the structure of the
        work to be done, which you can read about in the documentation for task definitions.


        Tasks can be created from any number of sources, including the API. The Source platform will
        generate tasks itself in many cases, such as when a member sends a mesasge to their care
        team. When Source generates a task automatically, we will also resolve it automatically when
        the work has been completed (for example, when the care team replies to the member.)

            queues, which represent a much more flexible way to route tasks to your team.

        Webhooks are our way of notifying you about new Events in your account.


        Once a webhook is registered and enabled, each event matching the list of subscribed events
        will be delivered to the endpoint you choose. Your webhook will receive a copy of the
        [Event](https://docs.sourcehealth.com/docs/api/reference/event/) object associated with the
        webhook.


        You can view more information about Source webhooks
        [here](https://docs.sourcehealth.com/docs/api/webhooks/).
